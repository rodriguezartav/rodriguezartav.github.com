<p>I dropped out my mayor and childhood dream in Aerospace Engineer at Penn State when I was 21 years old.</p>

<p>Back then this wasn't celebrated, you didn't hire drop-outs. I ended up working in a Call Center helping people change their Motorola ringtones.</p>

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Here's the truth for once. Life was great, grades not good. I kept myself on the Dean's List for the first 3 semesters. But I was quickly getting bored.</p>

<p>On my sophomore year I stopped going to class and hanged out in the Library reading about Advances Physics or played Football ( Soccer ) everyday. Studied just before the midterms or finals enough to get an ~A</p>

<h4>I realized that college was meant for the average person, who wants a job</h4>

<p>I was going to become an average person, so I dropped the atomic bomb on my future and return to Costa Rica.</p>

<h3>Proving I was right</h3>

<p>I am not the kind of person that makes mistakes in life, not because I am smart. But because I don't think when I make big decisions, I just do them.</p>

<p>Today we are at the verge of an academic revolution, 15 year old kids are changing the world with inventions and they need to wait 6 months for higher education folks to understand them.</p>

<p>Every smart person in the world is looking for alternative education, we are improving and liberating online education and the best minds don't even go to college anymore, even worse they dispise it.</p>

<h3>It's been hard</h3>
<p>Since my college days and after leaving Penn State things got really hard. I wished I did not had to go trough that just because I wanted more, I wanted to be like Newton, Faraday and Edison in a way. And college was not going to get me there.</p>

<p>I been searching for better ways to share knowledge ever since, <strong> the key is to be able to transfer knowledge as quickly and deeply as possible.</strong></p>

<h3>I found a way</h3>

<p>First we must let people develop their skills freely. We can't predict what opportunity will show up tomorrow for somebody, why would we establish the courses for that future then.</p>

<p>Last weekend we did an activity and got to transfer a months value of knowledge in 1 saturday. People who did not know anything about certain technology, but worked in the field where asked to create an Minumum Viable Product by Monday</p>

<p>The Key is to let people organize themselves, pick what they want to learn and present them with an impossible task.</p>

<p>Human nature, a teacher with practical experience and the internet has all the information you'll need to do anything.</p>

<p>Want to be a civil engineer, all right the first thing in college you do is a house. Spread the class in groups and start figuring out how it's done. You'll pick up the math and strength of materials on the way. </p>

<p>My way is the opposite, instead of preparing for uncertainty. Learning 4 years worth of teory that you'll forget in 10 years. Learn to learn and collaborate to get things done.</p>
